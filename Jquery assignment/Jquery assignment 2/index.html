    <p2 id="wiki">James Abram Garfield (1831â€“1881) was the 20th president of the United States, serving from March 4 to September 19, 1881. Garfield was born into poverty in a log cabin in Northeast Ohio. He was a Union major general during the American Civil War. Elected to Congress in 1862 to represent Ohio's 19th district, he served nine terms, gaining a reputation as a skilled orator. He also wrote a notable proof of the Pythagorean theorem, published in 1876. Selected as a compromise candidate at the 1880 Republican National Convention, Garfield won the general election. As president he oversaw a resurgence of presidential authority against senatorial courtesy in executive appointments, a purge of corruption in the Post Office, and the appointment of a Supreme Court justice. Garfield advocated an educated electorate and civil rights for African Americans. He was shot on July 2, 1881, and died from infections caused by his doctors.
